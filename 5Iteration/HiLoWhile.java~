/* This program will prompt the user to enter 10 values and the program must
detect the smallest integer value and the largest integer value. This program
uses a while loop.

import scanner and declare class and string args
declare variables and scanner
prompt the user to enter an integer value and save it as largest and smallest
start while loop for everything less than series of 10
and ask user to input value for a number
start if statement if it's smaller than the original value inputed
	if it is, assign the value to the smallest
start else if statement if it's larger than the original value inputed
	if it is, assign the value to the largest
add a step to the counter (loop control variable)
print the result for the user (smallest and largest values) */
